The following tracks in sounds/ambient are used to play audio in space. The track is chosen by the system but based on what faction owns the system. The mp3 tracks include are AI generated instrumentals. Some generic ambient music, I generated online. The first 4 tracks simply repeat on down to trackg the last 2 are 5 seconds of blank sound.
Users will want to replace them with their own music.

track1 - Republic
track2 - Coalition
track3 - Syndicate
track4 - Quarg
track5 - Hai
track6 - Hidden
track7 - Uninhabited
track8 - Avgi
track9 - Bunrodea
tracka - Gegno
trackb - Houses
trackc - Kor
trackd - Korath
tracke - Pirate
trackf - Remnant
trackg - Successor
trackh - Wanderer
tracki - Others (misc.)

How this Plugin was Made

Using a simple text editor, I created a copy of "map systems.txt" removing all but the root system name and the government to which they belong.
I replaced the government names with music tracks in my copy. Note the TAB indent is very important in the plugin.
I generated a simple icon and some AI music samples and have background music as I fly from system to system.

Enjoy.
